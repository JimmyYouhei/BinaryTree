# BinaryTree
##	Introduction 
This is my own Binary Search Tree class that is written by me from scratch . The purpose is to learn more about Binary Search Tree
##	Version: 
-	It is written by using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2019.1.3 x64
-	JDK version 11
##	How to install:
If you use IntelliJ IDEA use new -> Project From Version Control -> Git and paste https://github.com/JimmyYouhei/BinaryTree.git
##.	How to use: 
-	Using the Main class to run and test any method 
-	The BinarySearchTree class is fully written with method: 
    -	add(int value) : add a new node with the value to the tree
    -	isContained(int value): search and return the Boolean if the tree contains the value  or not 
    -	remove (int value): delete (or in some case replace) the node with the value , print out warning if the node is not found 
    -	printInOrder(): actually the name could be Traversal In Order but it reflect more accurately what the method does.  
##	Note:
-	Due to the class is written purely for learning purpose so very little Exception handle is expected 
-	Except for the printInOrder() method , all of the other part is written by me from scratch based on the description (Of course I may peek at a small part of code from others on the internet). However the printInOrder() method was too complex for me due to my poor skill at Recursion . As a result I referenced the code from here:  https://www.programiz.com/dsa/tree-traversal
